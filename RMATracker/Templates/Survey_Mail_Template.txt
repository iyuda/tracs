Troubleshooting 

Check/Tighten ACS-1E Panel screw terminals for the card reader cable(s). Checked: 
Yes


Remove MMR Card Reader B-Nuts, re-twist cables and re-crimp B-Nut connections. Checked:
Yes

Make sure B-Nut is completely inserted over twisted cables where no bare wires can be seen at the base of each B-Nut. Checked:
Yes


Check for possible splice(s) within cable or cable picking up EMF interference from other equipment or light fixtures touching or close to the card reader cable. Checked: 
Yes

Cable Moved:
No

  
Take Picture of the both ends of the existing Cable. 
Picture Taken? Yes



Is the Jacket of the Card Reader Cable and the colors of the each card reader cable identical?
Yes



Record Ohms of Resistance for each pair of cables:
           
Pair 1 Ohms: 2.3       
Pair 2 Ohms: 2.3        
Pair 3 Ohms: 2.4       
Pair 4 Ohms: 2.4



Card Reader Cable is cable from:

22 Ga.
Other: 
   
Does the Cable have Twisted Pairs? 
No 


Did/Does Card Reader Cable need to be replaced?
No
 
Did you install a new Card Reader Cable?
No 

If a return visit is required to replace the cable, circle and/or note the following requirements:

Overlay Alarm

Make note of any observations of activity within the Video that may have contributed to the Overlay Alarm:


MMR-SkimGard Overlay Installation Obstructions

Obstructions Found? No
Describe Obstructions:

Picture Taken: Yes




Check if the ATM Lobby Door/Pull Handle interferes with the Card Reader Overlay Scanning area.
Obstructions Found? No
Describe Obstructions:
N/a
Picture Taken: Yes



Check Card Reader for foreign objects or materials installed over the SkimGard-MMR faceplate and/or Sensors. 
Obstructions Found? No
Describe Obstructions:

Picture Taken: No


Check with on-site branch, service or construction personnel if objects have been placed in front of or near the MMR Card Reader or the ATM Door was propped open during the reported Overlay Alarm event time. 
Obstructions Reported? No
Describe Obstructions:

Picture Taken: No

If the Overlay Alarm is asserted within the first 30-35 minutes of the power on, and none of the above physical restrictions exist, then replace the SkimGard/MMR Card Reader.
Make any notes of additional findings:


           
New MMR Reader #1 Serial #:        
New MMR Reader #2 Serial #: 


Tamper Alarms

Make note of any observations of activity within the Video that may have contributed to the Tamper Alarm: 


With a Multi-Meter, test the continuity of the Tamper switch wires within the collar (carefully depress down onto the silver tab of the Tamper switch, continuity should show a close/off when the silver tab is depressed and an open/on when you let go of the silver tab on the Tamper switch).
Continuity Tests OK: Yes
Changed Switch: Yes   

Inspect the Tamper Switch wires (two white wires within the collar) for damage and then inspect the Tamper switch wire contacts for a broken/cold solder joint.
Cables/Solder Joint Show Damage: No
Changed Switch: Yes  

If the Tamper alarm LED turns off by shorting the MMR white wires and you’ve verified the Tamper switch and Tamper Circuit within the MMR are working correctly, begin to test the accelerometer within the MMR Reader.

If the ACS-1E Panel is far away (> 20 seconds from you tilting the MMR) from the MMR Reader you can verify the Accelerometer Tamper signal by viewing the ACS-1E Event Panel Messages. 
Replaced MMR Reader: No 

Reinstall the MMR Reader to check if the MMR Reader is actuating the Tamper switch. If the Tamper Alarm LED remains on, the Tamper switch is not engaged with the installed MMR Reader, replace the collar.  
Replaced Collar: No 

Thoroughly inspect the MMR Card Reader module for any material within the card slot, possible intrusion or modification.
Inspection Results: (Describe) 

Picture Taken: No


Did you find the ACS-1E Card Reader Serial # “Learn Jumper” shunted? No
